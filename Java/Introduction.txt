Question- What is java?
Answer- 
-> Java is a class-based object-oriented programming language.
-> Though we can not consider it to be fully object-oriented as it supports primitive data types, and these primitive data types don't directly belong to the Integer 
   classes.
-> Java is a High level programming language.Java is a platform because it has its own runtime environment that is JVM(Java Virtual Machine).
-> JVM provides a platform which  accepts the  byte code and executes on the machine.


Question- Features of Java?
Answer- 
1)Platform Independent:- 
- Java is a platform independent(write once run anywhere). 
- Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux ,  Mac/OS, etc.
- Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. 
- This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, for  example Windows, Linux, or macOS this means that we can compile a
  program on windows then we can run it on Linux as well, and so on.

2)Portable:- Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.

3)Secure:- 
a) JVM:- - JVM is Java Virtual Machine.
         - Its basic role is to verify the bytecode before it is run. This make sure that program is not making any unsafe operations . 
	 - for eg. a program go to wrong location and fetch data instead of information.
	 - JVM reduce the loop hole and safety flaws in memories.
		     
b) Security Manager:- - Security Manager layer is present in JVM.
 		      - It make sure that the untrusted code doesnt manage to access some APIs and features of the  platform.
       
c) No Pointers:- Java Does not support pointers. In this hacker does not point the memory address and the things which is stored in the memory is become safe.
	   
d) Access Modifiers:- If we want to hide some code then we use access modifier, if we want that our code or data should not be override then we use  final 
	              keyword, which again adds security to java.                                                                                             
	   
e) Exception Handling:- In this if our code have minor exception also then also our code is not compiled.
          
4) Object Oriented : Java is based on OOPs concept through this the Software quality and productivity increased and maintainance cost is decreased.

5) Robust:- Java can handle all type of exception that's why it is robust and beacause of it, it will decrese the chance of crashing software.

6) Multithreading:- It will increase the speed and performance of software,  beacause in multithreading we can divide the task into many subtasks.

7) Java is simple as compared to c and c++ because some features work automatically in java like memory management and garbage collection and java does not
   contain any complex features like pointers, multiple inheritances, operator overloading, etc.
